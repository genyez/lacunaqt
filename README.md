This is a qt version of the AMAZING board game Lacuna, which I was promoted in GDC2024.



Official website of the original game https://www.cmyk.games/products/lacuna

Thanks to all the staffs in the boardgame lounge, specially thanks to Neil the Handsome who taught me this game.
* Definitly I made a typo in the beggining to make this repo named *lucanaqt*, ignore that will ya :(?

It is a WIP project and anyone is welcomed. 

Features in progress(and help hands wanted!):
- image identification by webcam
- auto solver with min-max search
- transplant to Unity/Unreal by LLM refactor
